## The Look-Ahead Bias Problem

Large Language Models are increasingly used by quants for research, signal generation, and portfolio construction. However, most general-purpose LLMs suffer from a critical flaw in financial settings: **look-ahead bias**.

Because they are trained on web-scale corpora that include post-hoc market commentary, earnings reports, and retrospective analyses, standard LLMs often *implicitly know the future*. This leads to artificially inflated backtest results that collapse once the model is deployed on genuinely unseen data.

In finance, this problem is especially severe. Temporal causality matters. A model that “knows” NVIDIA surged in 2023 is not predicting — it is recalling. As a result, impressive historical performance often evaporates the moment the evaluation window moves past the model’s training cutoff.

## Pitinf: Point-in-Time LLMs for Finance

**Pitinf models** are purpose-built to solve this problem.

Pitinf is a family of **Point-in-Time (PiT) Large Language Models**, trained and aligned to strictly respect temporal cutoffs. Each model only has access to information that would have been available at a specific point in time, eliminating future data leakage by design.

This makes Pitinf models fundamentally different from standard foundation models:

- No memorized future prices or events  
- No hidden contamination from post-cutoff data  
- No inflated backtests that fail in live conditions  

The Pitinf family is available in three sizes to match different production needs:

- **Pitinf-Small (~10B parameters):** low-latency inference for real-time workflows  
- **Pitinf-Medium (~100B parameters):** strong reasoning for research and systematic strategies  
- **Pitinf-Large (~500B+ parameters):** frontier-grade reasoning for complex, multi-agent trading systems  

## Proven Performance Without Alpha Decay

To evaluate temporal robustness, we introduced **Look-Ahead-Bench**, a standardized benchmark that measures how model performance changes between in-sample and out-of-sample periods using **alpha decay**.

The results reveal a clear pattern:

- **Standard LLMs** achieve high in-sample returns but suffer severe performance collapse when moved to post-cutoff periods.
- **Pitinf models** maintain stable performance across market regimes, showing little to no alpha decay.

This leads to what we call the **Scaling Paradox**:

- For standard LLMs, larger models perform *worse* out of sample due to stronger memorized priors.
- For Pitinf models, scaling *improves* performance, because additional capacity enhances reasoning rather than memorization.

In practice, this means Pitinf-Large behaves like a true reasoning engine — not a historical lookup table.

## Built for Real-World Deployment

Pitinf models are designed for quants who care about **deployable performance**, not leaderboard metrics. They integrate naturally into agentic trading systems, research pipelines, and backtesting frameworks where temporal integrity is non-negotiable.

If you are building trading agents, running systematic strategies, or evaluating LLMs for financial decision-making, Pitinf models give you something rare: **results you can trust out of sample**.
